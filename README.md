# Code Review Test

## Purpose

This project came out of a continued frustration with traditional code tests for the interview process. Code tests are either build for ease of review and speed of development, which makes them pointless. Most people will do easy things the same way, which gives you no insight.
Or the test can be complex and challenging enough to realy showcase the candidate's skills and thought process then it's in-depth enough to unnecessarily extend the interview process.I've also long been frustrated with the "trivia question" interview style, wher the "interviewer" asks a bunch of questions that require no knowledge, no interpretation, and no opinion. They have static, discrete, answers that you either remember or look up on StackOverfow. This also tells us nothing about a candidate and is a completel waste of time.

As a response to an ultimately useless process, I started inverting the script. I created a .Net project and ask candidates for a code review. Code reviews focus attention on thought processes, attention to detail, and priorities. It showcases communication skills while revealing a candidate's mentoring potential. As an added bonus, they don't take long to perform. As a result, we have a process that gives the information necessary about a candidate, gives a framework for a discussion-based interview rather than a trivia-based Q&A.

## Construction and Architecture

Everything in this repo was created with the intention of causing discussion. Some will illicit a very abstract and necessarily opinionated discussion. This is important for both the candidate and the interviewer to really understand each other. Some are obvious. Objective, I'd dare say. A candidate who misses these has some real gaps.

Best of all, ChatGPT is useless here. Even if "AI" can give just as deep and opinionated a review of this code as a high-quality developer can, the developer must still go through the interview and be expected to explain, discuss, and defend the feedback given. It will quickly become obvious if a candidate did the work. Think of this as a Master's Thesis. It's not enough to write one, you have to defend it.

## Use of this repository

Free as in "beer". If you find value here, use it. If you want to fork and update the code for your own use, do so. I wouldn't hate a shout-out, but I won't insist on one either. If you agree with this process then find a way to implement it to make hiring better for the candidate and better for the hiring company.

I have locked down the main branch but if you have suggestions, feedback, and/or improvements, feel free to cut a branch and raise a PR. Or fork the project. Or whatever. Branch names must start with "External/" so that it's easier for me to tell outside branchs from others.
